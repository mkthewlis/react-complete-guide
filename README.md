# Introduction to React

This simple app was created while completing the *React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)* course on Udemy. 

It allows users to toggle whether users names are visible and change their names to what is typed in the corresponding input field.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
